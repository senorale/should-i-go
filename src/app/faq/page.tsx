        either way. For many people a trade or apprenticeship is the better answer.

        We total the cost of the degree (tuition or net price, loan interest, and the
        wages given up while studying), then divide by how much more a graduate earns each
        year than someone with only a high-school diploma. That gives the number of years
        for the higher salary to pay back the investment.

        By default, an illustrative {C.STUDENT_LOAN_INTEREST_RATE}% rate on a standard
        10-year plan. Real rates change yearly, and income-driven or longer plans stretch
        repayment and interest well beyond 10 years. In practice the average borrower owes
        about $39,000 and takes up to 20 years to repay, at roughly $200 to $299 a month (
